# DiamondQ

 DiamondQ uses the new revolutionary "Q" contract that benefits holders
 and punishes "paper hands". The timing of each buy is tracked by the
 contract, the longer you hold the tokens the less tax you pay on a sell.
 The extra tokens that are taxed are simply sent to the burn wallet so all
 holders benefit even more by the supply becoming more and more scarce.

 *Buy tax*
 ```
 Tax is the same no matter the time (5%):
     5% to the house wallet
 ```    
     
 Sell tax:
 ```
 If selling within 7 days (30%):
     5% sent to the house wallet
     25% sent to the burn wallet
     
 If selling within 7-14 days (20%):
     5% sent to the house wallet
     15% sent to the burn wallet
     
 If selling withing 14-21 days (10%):
     5% sent to the house wallet
     5% sent the burn wallet
     
 If selling after 21 days (5%):
     5% sent to the house wallet
 ```
